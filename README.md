# secp256r1_Signature_Rust
In this repo I am implementing couple of "secp256r1' signature scheme funcctionalities.

# Implementation Lists
-	Implement the secp256r1 signature scheme for generating and verifying digital signatures.
-	Write a function to convert a private key to a public key, which will be used for signing transactions.
-	Write a function to generate a new private key for each owner of the wallet.
-	Define a function to encode the transaction data for signature verification.
-	Implement unit tests for the secp256r1 signature scheme and the encoding function.
-	Write a function to verify a transaction's signature, including the transaction ID, public key, and signature.
-	Implement error handling for invalid signatures and public keys.
-	Write tests for the signature verification function, including edge cases and invalid input scenarios.
-	Implement a function to validate the wallet policy before approving a transaction, including the number of required signatures and the list of owners.
-	Write unit tests for the wallet policy validation function, including edge cases and invalid input scenarios.
